        <h5>Introduction:</h5><br><br>
        <p>Hello, my name is Mark McCorkle. I am 42 and returned to school in 2017 as a nontraditional student after a 9-year hiatus. I am originally from the great city of Hope, Arkansas. I moved to Malvern in 2009 for a job relocation and I have stayed here ever since. I have four children, two boys and two girls, ranging from seven to eighteen. I am a husband to a beautiful and creative wife for over twenty wonderful years. I spend most of my time with one of three things: family, work, and school. Outside of that, I occupy any spare time with my two favorite hobbies: programming and hobby rocketry. Programming for twenty years on a non-professional level has led to where I am today; to pursue a Bachelorâ€™s of Science degree in Computer Science at UALR. I can program in several languages: C/C++, Assembly, C#, Python, Bash/PowerShell, and other languages on a lesser scale. Rocketry, my other hobby, has been one of my favorite outdoor activities. It has taught me a lot, but one being the most import one: the rabbit hole goes as far as you want. The challenges of the structural design, dynamics, and sheer complexity accentuate the enjoyment as I see my work take flight.</p>
